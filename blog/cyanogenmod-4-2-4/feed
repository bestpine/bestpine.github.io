		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I&#039;ve been trying to get the rom running for a while not but always end up with the same result.  After running the procedure successfully I reboot the device and it invariably end upon the bootloader screen.  I have tried many variations and versions but I answays end up at the same point...   that dreaded bootloader...

At which point I can only come back to the original and use the stock, unrooted image.

running a bit desperate here :-)

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just confirmed that &quot;Wall Switcher&quot; causes the reboots too.

I sent a tweet to @cyanogen about it.

Moral of the story: if 4.2.4 is spontaneously rebooting on you and  you&#039;re using a wallpaper auto-changing app, uninstall that app and be reboot free.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fellow sufferers of the spontaneous reboots...

Mine was rebooting when sitting idle with the screen off.

I don&#039;t want to unfairly malign an app, but since I uninstalled the app named &quot;Wallr&quot; I&#039;ve not had any reboots on 4.2.4

If you&#039;re suffering spontaneous reboots, are you running &quot;Wallr&quot;?  If you are, does uninstalling Wallr make the reboots stop for you too?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[-Screen Timeout issue after update-

I am kind of losing my mind over this. It seems after I installed the new update anytime my screen times out or I manually lock it, the application I am using will close. I have verified that it will actually kill the process I am running. This is particularly irritating when listening to music as the song will simply stop playing if i don&#039;t keep the screen from timing out.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any help or thoughts would be welcome @ this point.]]></description>

Damnit.  Of course.  Yes, back on 4.2.3.1.   Makes perfect sense.   I&#039;ve just restored what I wiped.  *sigh*

Doubt that wipe made any difference but will try again.  I uninstalled a lot of apps that weren&#039;t working or weren&#039;t being used.  Maybe the root of my problem got thrown out.  Will post later if I get it working.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
     Have run into this problem 3 times now - twice on 4.2.3 and once on 4.2.4:

I got an incoming call (in the latest case while I was trying to make an outgoing call). When I tried to accept the call, the phone seemed to ignore all input and just kept ringing and ringing. The only way to get out of the state was to pull out my battery :-(

Otherwise the new OS (with the new maps) is just wonderful!]]></description>
