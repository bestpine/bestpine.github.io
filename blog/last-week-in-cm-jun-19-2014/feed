		<description><![CDATA[As a consolation prize, this deadness is a result of the fact that Sony is going the way of Blackberry, and shedding VAIO (which has been losing money for years now) hasn&#039;t helped them much. Eventually you&#039;ll be able to get a (probably upgraded) Z3 at firesale prices, or even a Z4/5 if Sony survives that long (I&#039;d be surprised if they do).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If its experimental, then why are they removing Dalvik? About half of apps in the store haven&#039;t been updated in years and never will be, so ART will be an unmitigated disaster. Seriously, compatibility mode or no CM12.

I&#039;ve grown pretty angry with Cyanogenmod due to unresolved issues that have been around since CM9 and the monthly release schedule that leaves tons of glitches that wouldn&#039;t have even made it to RC in CM10.1/2.

However most of the alternate ROMs I&#039;ve tried are based on Cyanogenmod, and if Cyanogenmod abandons Dalvik completely then anyone who doesn&#039;t have a Top 50 device (Paranoid and AOKP still don&#039;t support much of anything) is screwed. Half of their phone will instantly break, possibly even core System apps on initial monthly builds of CM12 and its distros.]]></description>
