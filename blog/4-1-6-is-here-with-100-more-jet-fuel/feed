		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m loving the speed, it&#039;s like purchasing a new phone. I&#039;m getting the reboot bug though. It happened twice so far, and one of them was when I was on an important phone call...so I think I will revert back to the latest stable release. 

Thank you so much for everything you&#039;ve done. I can&#039;t wait for your next stable release.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great rom and like it a lot. 

One of the complains that I have with Android is that it shutdown the program(s) that I&#039;m using whenever it &quot;sees fit&quot;. I can understand that when memory is low, or a process is out of wack, it needs to be shutdown, but with 250MB+ free memory on mytouch and when a process is NOT consuming cpu, it still gets shutdown, many times as soon as I swtich to a different app (and come back). The restarting of the program and restore of states is not much of an issue in this case, the much bigger problem is that most of the programs I&#039;m using talk to the internet - re-downloading and rendering the contents take quite bit time to the point it becomes an annoyance. 

Can this behavior be adjusted in custom roms?]]></description>

I have a PIN protected SIM card and when I leave my phone alone for a long time (like several hours) then when I come back it tells me that I need to punch SIM PIN. I don&#039;t know if the phone has restarted or not.]]></description>
