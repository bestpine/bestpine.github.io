		<description><![CDATA[Just updated my SGH-T989 to CM10.1 Stable. Graphics rendering and performance has increased in quality compared to the RC builds but it&#039;s still slower than CM10. Lags are present in apps where no blip in performance existed on 4.1 Jelly Bean. Setting the governor to ondemand doesn&#039;t really do much good as there are multiple hiccups in apps still present.

Well, I&#039;ll try a fresh install first to see if that was the problem but if not, I&#039;ll revert back to CM10.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[RC5 on my T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy SII (SGH-T989 or &#039;Hercules&#039;) runs GREAT but I&#039;m already down to 85% after one hour....with the phone in my pocket and screen off. (It used to be at 95% after an hour with light usage)

Honestly, I could care less as I have an external charger and two spare batteries but I hope this problem gets fixed for others who use the same handset as mine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since the i9100 is the international version with either an Exynos or OMAP chipset, RC builds for such are not available as both SoC&#039;s aren&#039;t open-sourced, especially given Samsung&#039;s lack of reliable info regarding their Exynos processors. (Not sure about OMAP yet)

In contrast, some Galaxy S2&#039;s such as the T-Mobile Galaxy S2 have CM10.1 RC builds as it uses a Snapdragon S3 clocked at 1.5GHz so there&#039;s much more support for the device despite its slight obscurity.]]></description>
