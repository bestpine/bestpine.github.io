		<description><![CDATA[Hi
Sorry to use this space but I&#039;m freaking out... I tryed to update my MyTouch to the 4.1.999 and now my phone won&#039;t boot up.  I installed the first rom required (the oe published by HTC) and my phene never came back.  Now, I have (or should I say had) the cm-recovery 1.4, but it has also crash and it keeps showing me this triangle sign with a phone, and I can&#039;t do anything.  I tried to conect the phone USB to the computer and the computer won&#039;t reconize the phone on fastboot USB, my computer does reconize the phone when I turn it on normally (although it passes the android screen, it does not do anything else, it stays black).  At this stage, the computer does reconize the phone, and I&#039;m using the adb on the cmd, but first it says permission denied, then if I type cd system\xbin\su, I have permissions but nothing can be found (not even help)

Please someone help me... I hope my phone is not bricked yet... I mean at least it turns on and something!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good idea, but would that be specific to CyanogenMod, or in general?

Maybe that&#039;s something that can go in the WIKI section......]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good job, was wondering when this was going to happen.

Any chance of providing a working build environment or some sort of tutorials/guide how to set one up as I know me and fairly few others would like to build their own from your source.

Anyway good job with the ROMs]]></description>
