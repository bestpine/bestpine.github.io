		<description><![CDATA[I have had 4.1.11.1 for about two weeks now and it is awesome. Very fast! 

I have tethering for root users and it works great john. However, I am not sure if it is the cyanogen rom (it was doing it before i flashed it; maybe cos it wasnt rooted before) but whenever i have my earphones plugged in, as soon as i get a call or a message the sound on the phone completely goes away for messages, media and phone calls. The phone makes no sound whatsoever until i reboot. And it sucks cos when im at work and im listening ot a podcast or something i am constantly getting emails and messages so i reboot about every thirty minutes now, it sucks.

any suggestions before i have to wipe, and reflash to go back down to the stable cyanogen rom?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On 4.1.11.1, it has been great so far. I did a wipe before installing. The one thing I noticed is that it doesn&#039;t have a option to have both vib &amp; ring. I don&#039;t know if it is left out of 1.6 or if it was some how not brought in.  Other wise I haven&#039;t seen any real operating issues yet, been three days. I have to say I&#039;m glad the google thing is getting worked out. I thought google was cool for a minute for letting people do as they like. It still had google&#039;s name all over it and cyanogen only made it better, thus improving they&#039;re name. But what ever. I say jump over to openmoko and hack out a ubuntu mobile based rom leave android in the dust if they can&#039;t work it out. Thanks for the hard work cyanogen!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I went back to 4.0.4 because I can&#039;t use the bluetooth features on 4.1.11.1 Has anyone noticed the Bluex app doesn&#039;t allow send or receive with this version? I also had trouble with tetherwifi because my laptop never recognized filesharing or tethering features until I down-graded. Also, I had a lot of errors with apps not recognizing super-user permissions...perhaps I screwed it up somehow...but I don&#039;t ever remember messing with the lib. Bottom line, mytouch3g runs much smoother and stable with the 4.0.4 release, minus the extra stuff gone. :( Next ROM is gonna be much better I hope! Btw...thanks CyanogenModder! Your Roms are MUCH better than ANYONE ELSE!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Bob:
What has happened is that you do NOT have a new recovery image installed (that menu you get when you boot with home+power).  I can tell because you don&#039;t have enough menu choices.

Without something like the cyanogenmod or JesusFreak recovery image, you cannot flash custom ROMs.  You may have installed a new recovery image at one time, but if the STOCK firmware boots, even from a modified recovery image, then the firmware itself will overwrite the recovery image with the STOCK one.
You have to root again, flash the recovery image again, and then get the custom firmware installed WITHOUT letting the stock firmware boot up.
You haven&#039;t done any damage or anything, you just have to start over.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How exactly do I install the ROM? I am rooted and have the Cyanogen app. I downloaded to my SD card the latest build, but when I &quot;APPLY&quot; it and then reboot into recovery mode it I do that. Once in Recovery Mode it gives me the option to: 

1. reboot system now [Home+Back]
2. apply sdcard:update.zip [Alt+S]
3. wipe data/factory reset [Alt+W]

I choose #2 and then it says it is 
Finding the update package...
Opening the update package... 
Verifying the update pacakage, 
E:No signature (377 files),
E:Verification failed,
Installation aborted.

--Install From sdcard...
Finding the update package...
Opening the update package... 
E:Can&#039;t open /sdcard/update.zip
(No such file or directory)
Installation aborted.

I tried renaming the modded ROM file to &quot;update.zip&quot; and still nothing. I have no idea how to do this. I tried to look for a way to get this to work, but have come up empty handed. I hope someone here can please help.

Thanks]]></description>
