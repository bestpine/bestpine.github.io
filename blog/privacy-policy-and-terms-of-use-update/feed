		<description><![CDATA[And I love your sarcastic and accusing tone you got here. It&#039;ll b nice for a solid response than this sarcastic tone you are playing with. He is right when he says at least Dropbox had an opt out option when they did this. Such crude response, I would have thought someone like your position would have actly more should I say, friendly and helpful manner. Its suspicious and you aren&#039;t helping at all with CM and this arbitration stunt you ate playing the community, I turned a blind eye when CM decided to turn mainstream and said cool, thstll make them grow and it&#039;ll make the ROM so much better because it&#039;ll get wide support but these little schemes are starting tonget worrisome. Its all about the money now, customer response second smh]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You solved your problem, use other roms that use CM features, I for one can&#039;t leave privacy guard which is kind of hypocritical with these new terms, not unless arbitration is still in fact in other roms for using CM features]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Every company turns evil sooner or later (just like Samsung).


But luckily, this might not be acceptable in EU, i think you could still sue those evil companys (CM is now included) in EU, because those terms might be illegal in EU (i&#039;m nto sure tho), but i too think people should slowly back away from CM, i hope Linux for mobile will come back in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The beauty of Android is that other ROMs have Cyanogenmods features incorporated into their ROMs like C Rom for example on hammerhead. So we may not be using CM as our ROM but we have those features CM has without arbitration. Honestly I see no point in arbitration, it&#039;ll be great if we get a solid response then a sarcastic response and tone from Ciwrl ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If Cyanogen does anything worth suing over -- say, they start selling your private information to third parties even though the Privacy Policy says they can&#039;t – you are no longer allowed to sue them in an actual court, unless you&#039;re going after damages so small that they belong in small-claims court. 

Instead, you get to go to binding arbitration, where there&#039;s no option for jury trial, no appeal, no oversight by any public official...basically, no guarantee that the law will be followed. But it&#039;s faster and cheaper than going before an actual judge, so it saves money for Cyanogen and its investors.

Oh, and you also have to give up your right to participate in a class-action case. If something bad were to happen on a large scale – for instance, if a supposedly “stable” CM release permanently bricked every device it was installed to – every single person affected would have to sue separately. 

If you live in a country where your right to court access and/or class-action litigation is protected by law, then this doesn&#039;t affect you. But the United States is not such a country. You can thank the Supreme Court for that!]]></description>
