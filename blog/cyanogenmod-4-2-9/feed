		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Cyanogen.  That random music bug was the one thing between me and dumping my iPod Touch for Last.FM and the headphone adapter I jacked from an HTC Fuze when I worked for AT&amp;T.  It used to sometimes recognize as a headset, and because the adapter doesn&#039;t have music control buttons, it&#039;d get random button presses and start listening to random music.  Stutteringly.  

I&#039;m experiencing SLLOOOOOOOOWWWW (like 3-7 mins) boots after flashing with CM-Updater.  It seems to get worse after every upgrade, but after the first boot post-flash the problem goes away and I can beat OS5.0 Blackberries with no problems.  Anyone else seeing this?]]></description>

First clean up your swap and ext3 partitions. Put DRC83_base_defanged ROM and CM Update on your SD (fat 32 paRTITION) Then wipe once or twice. Install DRC83_base_defanged then CM update and then reboot (do not reboot between installing DRC83_base_defanged and CM Update). After that you are ready to go. Enjoy]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great work here Cyan. Fastest yet. I really do love this rom. I laugh at a few acquaintances who still are stock.

I had an issue with google-maps. But I have had multiple issues with the  nav-abled maps. Just reinstalled it.

Also get the missing icons from the desktop sometimes. So I just use the drawer. A minor inconvenience at best!

Great work man! Merry Xmas]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For who was asking about... I&#039;m having problems with missing sms too.
I&#039;m using SMS Popup and the standard sms android application. I can read the message once through SMS Popup, after that I cannot find it anymore inside conversation thread.
This just appens sometimes and I still have no idea why.
I&#039;m also using SMS Backup... maybe it could be related.

Apart from this issue, Cyanogen 4.2.9.1 is fantastic!
Really. Thanks ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@zmesler
Thank you for the info (updating over updates) = bad idea. I&#039;m not sure why this is, but It does make sense, as every update after update after update = buggier. Here is what I did (this time). #1 Make a Nandroid backup, #2 wipe, #3 apply update (4.2.9).zip... restarted phone, did get one forceclose (for the startup app) while it was registering for Mobile Defense...  First thing I&#039;ve done was go to the market, am updating all my apps. That seems to work.

I ask if I missed a step and if its a *big* deal. step = putting the stock rom on the phone first. I believe the last time I did this it unrooted my phone, had to start the process over from scratch. I do remember whatever ROM being very fast stable. I&#039;m curious as to what steps you take PRIOR to wipe, wipe, apply update (4.2.9).zip in case I continue to have issues.

ThanX]]></description>
