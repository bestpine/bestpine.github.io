		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve made 3 successful youtube tutorials for rooting, and adding custom roms, including Jfv1.42 , Haykuro&#039;s Cupcake effort, and Jfv1.51.
I&#039;ve made an incomplete JacHERO tutorial, but ultimatly decided against posting it after requirments changed too frequently. I&#039;d be happy to help in any way, using ddms (screen shot), Camtasia Studios, with clear voice overs.
here is the link to my videos http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC-T1Yf4m4s&amp;feature=channel_page]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You only need the market installed to get access to install the other google apps.

Why not just develop the rom without the google apps. Then let us find a pirate way to install the google market. If we own a google phone (Which I do) then we arent breaching any licence agreement.

Or maybe you could verify that a user has a google phone and only provide the market if they do. That would probably be enough to keep google happy.

Actually, don&#039;t google provide the apk for the market app via their developer site anyway?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hope you ONLY allow videos to be used with no slangs, and spell out every step exactly, assuming that everyone viewing the video will be doing the procedure for the FIRST time.  

Don&#039;t allow novice+ terms like FC or Radio.  It will only serve to confuse a newb. There is no such words found on the Android screens and should not be used.

The person who creates the video tutorial should keep the original so it can be easily edited.  In this day and age you shouldn&#039;t have to re-shoot the complete 5 minute video of your tutor video to make one little correction/update on a step or text overlay.]]></description>
