		<description><![CDATA[@disqus_ShXRRZxILY:disqus 


the double post is an error ,i asked for delete ,sorry ..


You don&#039;t have understood !
i just give &quot;example&quot; ...and i never critic great Cyanogenmod , i don&#039;t speak about his greats features too ...

it&#039;s just a simply idea . 

The aim is to create a pleasant rom with a &quot;own&quot; personality and dynamics inovations... but no an AOSP like Nexus experience.


it&#039;s not a request ,not any pretentious ...just an &quot;idea&quot; , 

but &quot;maybe&quot;  the begining of the future evolution of CM (THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO ! )

In the life ,YOU NEED to EVOLVE !!! otherwise that annoy more and more of people ... we want the &quot;new fesh air&quot;
The world change !!!

Actualy ,how many people download CM ??? just for to test ..... and how many go back to Stock (for Touchwiz ,Sense,Xperia ,optimus ...) ??? answer =&gt; more and more people !!! the reality !!!
CM begin to be a &quot;geekland&quot; area for just &quot;fan&quot; and/or &quot;old school&quot; ??? 



And i don&#039;t speak about bloatwares , but usefull functionalities ..it&#039;s different !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For me ,like many users i think ...i wait for a better design and 
inovations ,with attractive icons ...etc ....(like MIUI with his own 
style for example) ,and principaly a &quot;good&quot; launcher with folders 
creation ,apps that we can move on the drawer ...etc ...as we want + 
others greats customisations .
i wait better integrated basics apps (call SMS ..etc....) like Stock firmware too .

The
 aim is to obtain an attractive rom , not just a &quot;row&quot; AOSP ,summarily 
modified with just options adding...but a great user experience !!!! 
and  with goods possibilities completely useful ( like Samsung &quot;S-view cover&quot; for example ...)

 

What do you think about this &quot;dream&quot; ???!!!]]></description>
