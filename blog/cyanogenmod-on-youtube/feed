Thanks for your help.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s really good to have those helpful videos of yours publish on Youtube. Unfortunately for many Chinese people like me won&#039;t have a good access to your channel and thus subscribe and comment due to those who posted some very political videos intending to separate Tibet from China which caused the Chinese government blocked Youtube.com early this year. For those of many Chinese people who want to have a chance to watch the videos you will post on your new youtube channel won&#039;t be so easy. So I&#039;m thinking a way to have your videos posted on the Chinese popular video-sharing sites like youku.com to satisfy your fans in China would be a good choice if you grant me to do it. In that case, I think, you need to send me the videos every time you post them on youtube. If you think it is practical and willing to spend some time in helping me and many of your Chinese fans please contact me at gbs.ben@gmail.com.

Cheers,
Ben]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Congrats on all your recent adds. Hope you still have time doing your rom updates!!! Let you know that I can do some vids in American Sign Language as many Deaf love technology and would love learning how to do it. I just partitioned my 16GB card tonight and went fine. I also can show how to flash your roms. I have my own Youtube page and when I add video about cell phones it get the most hits. Let me know.]]></description>
