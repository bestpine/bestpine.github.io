		<description><![CDATA[Really confusing update issue.

I have a question. I was updating a friend&#039;s G1 from 4.0.2. I followed the instructions and everything was going through without a hitch. But as the G1 rebooted and began in install the Cyanogen ROM, the browser apk got corrupted and the installation was aborted. I was stuck. I didn&#039;t know what to do as this never happened to any of the other updates I&#039;ve performed on my g1. I had no choice but to reboot the phone. My friend&#039;s phone is now stuck on HTC&#039;s 1.6 ROM and I have no way (that I know of) to continue the update or even restore the phone through nandroid. The best I was able to do was use the backups we made in Mybackup Pro and get the phone running close to what it was before the attempt so she could at least use the phone.

As it stands now, I get this error when I boot into the default Recovery ...E:Can&#039;t open /cache/recovery/command   The phone works for the most part but it&#039;s obviously limited because of the unfinished update. I tried to get some help at XDA but the answers I got weren&#039;t helpful for lack of clear explanations at points or the assumptions that the whole world is android/linux/command line savvy.

How exactly would I get my friend&#039;s G1 from the HTC 1.6 ROM to 4.1.99 at this point?  Any help from anyone to get this situation cleared up would be greatly appreciated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sicen I&#039;ve put 4.2.2 on my Tmobile G1, theres this weird screen problem
The bottom and top of the screen become unresponsive. This usually happens after unlocking the screen.
The problem goes away when I Press End (standby) then press Menu to wake it up and unlock the screen.

As far as I know it didnt exist in 4.2.1... I&#039;ll flash back to that rom and see what happens.]]></description>
