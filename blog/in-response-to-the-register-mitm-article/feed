		<description><![CDATA[&quot;How about YOU give most of your time and commit yourself to developing Roms instead of relying on other people to do the job for you. I bet I wouldn&#039;t be wrong if I said that you had never donated to any of the devs/project?

Most idiotic comment I&#039;ve heard in long time.&quot;

Not that its any of yours or anyone else&#039;s business what my financial contributions are but you would be VERY wrong]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[you&#039;re really entitled? 

the means to support those &#039;older&#039; devices is all in the open &amp; you can take any of them and continue maintaining them at your leisure, if there is any support already then CM/others have done the significant legwork to get community builds off the ground.  I don&#039;t think CM is under any obligation to continue supporting devices perpetually.  If you&#039;ve chosen your device wisely, with regards to SOC and popularity etc, you can get an outstanding shelf life from CM.  If you chose something that was a hack to support initially, don&#039;t expect it to get carried around forever.  Additionally, major version upgrades are not done easily without updated assets from the OEM &amp; SOC vendors, so if your device is not in that group then it is a massive cost (sometimes impossible) for the community to provide a true upgrade build.  Older versions of CM still get security updates as well, so not getting the new version is not the same as being dropped entirely.

The only devices support is guaranteed for are the ones that Cyngn Inc has a business relationship with, so the N1 and 1+1, and the support terms are well defined there.

so, i disagree.]]></description>
