		<description><![CDATA[Apps means features.

		<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of Nemesis, but I hope they&#039;ll keep working on the apps in it too.  Focal has issues where it &quot;crashes&quot; the camera and you have to reboot to use it again just for instance.  I can&#039;t wait until it is stable, but until it is, it definitely still needs work.  We do need Project Nemesis as it is bringing to CyanogenMod some of the stuff that only OEM ROMs normally get and has a lot of potential, but it&#039;s definitely going to be a lot of work for the devs...


BTW, something seems to have been done very right in 10.1.3 RC2.  My battery life was extended quite considerably.  I hope whatever that was (and I have no clue what change it was that did it) stays in the final...  Well, at least with my SGS3.  I haven&#039;t tested on my Nexus 7 yet.  (I&#039;ll get around to it eventually!)  I wonder if there is a particular reason that no CyanogenMod version has any way built in at all to allow voltage changes?  I can understand such a thing not being available by default, but it seems like something you should be able to enable.  While I was in the process of trying to get my phone to get a better battery life, I also installed a different kernel (currently using &quot;dkp&quot;) and I was able to undervolt all frequencies by -125mA.  (This should also be better for the processor as long as things remain stable.)  Some people like to overvolt for better overclocking which can be dangerous of course and the reboots if undervolting too much can be bad, so I can see this being off by default, but a really hard to find setting or something maybe would be nice.]]></description>
