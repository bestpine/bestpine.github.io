		<description><![CDATA[@Wes @Adam, I have reinstalled wifi tether and still it reboots.  Are you both using bluetooth to connect? I&#039;m using &quot;wireless_tether_1_60-pre3_htc.apk&quot; So frustrating. I can use PDAnet fine but wireless tether was faster and I didn&#039;t have to carry a cord.  I will keep trying.  :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[firstly, thanks for all the hard work - i like this mod and my G1 does seem to be faster with some nifty extra features.

A couple of problems though.  Firstly the head phones (the standard ones which came with my G1) are no longer recognised - this happened with both 999 and 9999.

Also, as i think others have mentioned, my gmail doesn&#039;t sync.  When i checked the sync settings; my gmail was about 18 hours out of date and calender and contacts about 2 weeks.  Had to reboot before it finally worked]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wifi tether works just fine for me.  Make sure you are using Donut-compatible version.  

The best thing about 4.1.9999, however, is the battery life.  My G1 can go on a single charge for 2 days!  I can&#039;t remember the last time it would last this long.  Great work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@brie987 - I am running wireless thether for root users perfectly fine on 4.1.999. Its a bit glitchy, in that sometimes I need to stop the tether, and restart it before it actually transmits data to my comp. But once tethered correctly, its stable until I quit.

I haven&#039;t yet tried it with .9999. But I will get there soon.]]></description>
