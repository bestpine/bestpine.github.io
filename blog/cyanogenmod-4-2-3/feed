		<description><![CDATA[I read some thing related to your post at techcrunch... in any case, I believe car audio is normally misunderstood but has a handful of great quality manufacturers as well. -Regards, Jacklyn Mcarthy]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does anyone have contact with Cyanogen?  Is he still working on mods?  There hasn&#039;t been any activity for a few weeks, and while we all appreciate his efforts, there are a lot of people using his ROM&#039;s and would like to know if there will be more forthcoming?  This is not a complaint - just an observation....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Same problem as #45

On my G1 32B after upgrade from (less than)4.1.99 the way suggested by wiki (to 4.2.2 and then to 4.2.3.1):
1. Touch Input is terminated unexpectedly again and again and again. Solution: turn off Touch Input in Locale &amp; Text.
2. Calendar not working*
3. Market is not working*
* “window” of application disappears immediately after application is started
4. First run of Teeter – “Can be ran only on HTC devices”. Second try: “Application is not installed”.
Google maps seems ok (not tested very well).]]></description>
