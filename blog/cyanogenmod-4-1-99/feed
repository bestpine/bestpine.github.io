		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;ve installed the most recent ROM on my MyTouch, however when I boot to safe mode and attempt to use the console to partition my sd card, I cannot use the console. I click &quot;go to console&quot; but then I get stuck, as the MyTouch has no built-in keyboard, so I can&#039;t hit &quot;enter/return&quot;. I can&#039;t pull up a keyboard by holding down menu either. Any idea what&#039;s going on or how I could use console? thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I upgraded two g1’s to 4.1.99 and then to 4.1.999. First they were slow. I had to upgrade my ext2 partition to ext3. I did this from cyanogen recovery console, 4.1 Go to console, enter/return, on the keyboard and typed the command, upgrade_fs next to the # and then pressed enter.
First make sure you have recovery console 4.1 installed. Use this, in the instructions for installing it from the terminal emulator make sure you type, su then press the return/enter then type in the flash command per the instruction.

Then you must be in the 4.1 recovery console, you access by holding down the power and home buttons while rebooting, got to alt-x Go to console)
in console press enter/return
enter the command upgrade_fs then press enter/return then type reboot and press enter.
I then downlaoded everything I needed and put them on my sd card and installed following these instructions.

Worked like a charm and runs fast. Hope this helps.]]></description>
