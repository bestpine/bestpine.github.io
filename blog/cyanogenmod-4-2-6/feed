		<description><![CDATA[Apps download from Market but &quot;Installation of ...  was unsuccessful.&quot; or &quot;Installation Failure&quot; occurs for many, even those previously successful. 
Problem started when I upgraded from 1gb non-partitioned SD to 8gb partitioned SD. Some apps were lost in the upgrade and I haven&#039;t been able to restore them. Others work fine and upgrade with no problems, still others (even previously not installed apps) are unsuccessful.

Current config:
G1, Firmware 1.6, Kernel 2.6.29.6-cm42, CyanogenMod 4.2.9.1, Build DRC83, running apps2sd with class4 8gb SD partitioned as per 

Any suggestions? Is there a better place to post this question?

Thanks

		<description><![CDATA[When I updated from cm 4.2.5 to 4.2.6, I started noticing much unwanted lag. The next cm update (came just days later it seemed) 4.2.7.x, I didn&#039;t do a nandroid backup because I did not like how 4.2.6 was running. Turned out that 4.2.7.x was just the same, with or without a custom theme. I then began to wonder if I should reboot and do the nandroid backup to get back to 4.2.5 or install it again from the CM Updater app from the Market. Well, I re-installed (flashed) with the CM Updater app. All is well again with my phone and would recommend to anyone having issues with the same setup/issues as me, to do as I have done.

Phone: G1, T-Mobile, v1.6, RC83, SPL ???, cm-recovery 1.4
8 GB SDCard - 6.5 GB for files, 1,040 KB app partition, NO Swap partition. *So I have no access to some of the card&#039;s memory.
Theme: Any theme seems to work fine (I love seeing them all in action and testing their capabilities)


I&#039;d love to help anyone out with issues dealing with CyanogenMods on the G1. My FaceBook name is &quot;Craig Miller&quot; and email I use for FaceBook is CMicroTek@Yahoo.com]]></description>
