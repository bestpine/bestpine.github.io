		<description><![CDATA[&quot;we will start for free for THIS version but will add more for money?&quot; No. Core functionality will not be charged for. When we discuss avenues for eventual charge we lean more towards the service side (hypothetical example: say we build Secure storage - you get x amount free, and $y to add more). 

&quot;So will community version be less secure because of root or will they make it less secure for sake of using PRO?&quot; Yes (but not for some nefarious plot). 

Signing with test_keys is and has always been counter to Android&#039;s security model ( http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html ) - &quot;The Android system requires that all installed applications be digitally signed with a certificate whose private key is held by the application&#039;s developer.&quot; This applies at a system level too (ie each OEM has a key or multiple keys).

We&#039;ve historically signed with test_keys (ie not secure or private keys) because &#039;hacking&#039; is so core to the CM userbase - users like flashing external mods/frameworks/hacks/etc. Signing with priv_keys would prevent that level of freedom. 


So yes, the CE version is less secure because root (also highly dangerous) and the key signing situation - but the other side of that coin is that these systems are more hackable/customizeable by power users. We merely offer you the choice of which route matters more to you. 


&#039;Pro&#039; (I hate that name) will likely see a paired down build cycle (ie every 2 weeks instead of nightly) for that. Easy updates will be handled with incremental builds (easier for us to do with the paired down release cycle) and appear to the end user as no different than a Google/Carrier/OEM ota - just from us instead.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just few quotes from them:

&quot;The Pro name usually implies that such a software version would cost money or would offer features for pro users, but that’s not what’s happening with THIS ROM version&quot; - does this goes for - we will start for free for THIS version but will add more for money?

Also they state that &quot;Community Edition Designed for hackability

Pro Edition Designed for security &quot;
So will community version be less secure because of root or will they make it less secure for sake of using PRO?

And for all this easy updates for PRO - what happens to easy updates for nightlies?]]></description>
