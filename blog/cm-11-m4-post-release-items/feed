		<description><![CDATA[Hi guys, I&#039;m a  noob in CM, I&#039;m currently running CM 10.1.3 on my i9100, based on above guide there&#039;s no need to wipe data if I want to flash M4 on top of Stable, but how about the Gapps? do I need to install them too or it will be upgraded automatically after the rom is upgraded? Any help would be appreciated. 

Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys. I really appreciate what you are doing for us! I have one clarification question about the M releases... you say M/Stable... Up to this point I have only installed Stable build... would a M release be considered Stable? I&#039;m a tinkerer, but don&#039;t want to be bit by a feature or bug that might really effect my phone (i.e.: once, my phone wasn&#039;t able to connect to a cell tower until a release was put out.) I am excited about CM 11, but want to make sure it is usable for day to day before installing it.

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[drink your own brew, mewmew. accusing someone of not groking a development practice that&#039;s been around for decades when you yourself seem not to grasp the basic principles. breaking changes in nightly builds are par for the course. BRICKING changes are not. We&#039;ve all seen in the forums over the years, the occasional bad flash causing a brick, even features flipping out. There&#039;s enough evidence to show that the d2lte builds are a complete clusterfuck - and these problems exist in the source that&#039;s made it past QA. You&#039;re just another unobjective fanboy piling on to defend something that&#039;s indefensible. Move along, and lecture someone else who hasn&#039;t been on actual development teams with any midocum of responsibility to those consuming a product, free or otherwise.]]></description>
