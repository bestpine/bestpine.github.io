		<description><![CDATA[Actually i look at it as the consumer acting like they paid for something and didn&#039;t get what they wanted when they wanted it. It&#039;s free for God&#039;s sake, STFU and wait like everyone else. These are the same people that show up to a bar, try to schmooze the bouncer at the door (presumably with their girlfriend&#039;s anatomy as the offering)) to try to get in to a place they have no business going because they think they fit in. Memo to those people. You don&#039;t.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Exactly. It&#039;s the consumerist attitude: people expect &#039;them&#039; to give them what they want. Reasonable when you&#039;re paying good money for a product. Damn stupid if you&#039;re talking about an open-source, collaborative project. People should at least take the effort to go to the forums.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I get so tired of people complaining about &quot;when will my phone get 
 &quot; and &quot;my favorite custom kernel no longer 
works&quot;.  What&#039;s the number one rule for any developer/group releasing a 
rom (and CM&#039;s?)  Don&#039;t ask for ETAs, it&#039;s that simple.  And about your 
custom kernel issues, it&#039;s not CM&#039;s job to make sure it&#039;s compatible 
with every custom kernel, it&#039;s the kernel developers problem.  CM ships a
 working kernel (99.999% of the time), if you try new things (like a 
different kernel), don&#039;t nag them to &quot;fix&quot; the issue, it isn&#039;t their 
problem, you deviated from the stock one, their sources are public, wait
 for the kernel dev to fix it.

I love that fact that now they have financial backing, people just think roms for 
unsupported phones are just going to magically start appearing and CM is obligated to report to us.   I have to scan through 50 nags to see one relevant comment, and that is the one thing people shouldn&#039;t even be asking!  I feel like someone should just go through and mass delete ETA questions. 

Remember, this rom is free, you paid NOTHING for it, CM keeps us updated because they want to, they by no means are obligated or owe us anything.  They have provided free ROMs for years in their own free time (You ever tried doing what they do?  It takes a shit ton of time, and I have only dabbed in kernels).  I think 
they are honestly due for a payday after all these years (no I&#039;m not counting donations, I&#039;m talking a livable salary), and they are finally getting rewarded for their hard work and are making decent money.]]></description>
