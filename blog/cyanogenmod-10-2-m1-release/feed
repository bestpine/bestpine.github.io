		<description><![CDATA[I understand that Google Apps needs to be installed separately, but I&#039;m finding on my Nook Color that even after doing so, Google Play Services seems to constantly stop.


When trying to update (the first time it took me to the Play store, but not again and I can&#039;t find it in the store any more), when I tried to update, I got a message saying that it was incompatible with my device.


Any ideas?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I rooted my nook hd + with a 10.2 nightly from 11/20. Since then I have attempted updated to some newer nightly builds via the settings. Every time it downloads and when I choose to install it, I get the install failed screen. Am I missing a step in this process? ]]></description>
