		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I found the solution :
1/ Download CM-10.2 and gapps and put them at sdcrad.
2/ Extract the CM-10.2 zip file and keep boot.img somewhere on your PC.
3/ Boot on recovery and backup then install CM-10.2 then gapps zip file (without wiping anything).
4/ Boot on fastboot mode and flash the boot with the boot file that u got from the CM-10.2 zip file, generally u put boot.img file with fastboot bin and u execute the command : fastboot flash boot boot.img (u can find easly how to flash the boot there are lot of tutos).
5/ U reboot ur phone and it must be ok.

If it doesn&#039;t u can repeat to these posts...

Good luck]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Am what I did in the end was create a backup point but the phone wont work from that back up point either. So I had to clear the cache and reset the phone, apply 10.1.3 of CM and then reboot. Phone turns on but anytime i go to apply my back up point it wont work so ive lost all my apps and contacts!]]></description>
