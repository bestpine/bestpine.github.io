		<description><![CDATA[This build is working very well, but when I hold End and then choose either &quot;Reboot Phone&quot; or &quot;Power Off&quot; the animation on the shutdown window stops after a few seconds and the phone doesn&#039;t reboot or turn off even after a couple of minutes.  Nothing odd when I pull the battery and boot, though.

The only reason I have for rebooting is to get Bluetooth A2DP working for my morning walk; the speed of this build is great!!  I&#039;ll be sending in a $ donation today.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok I figured out that Touch Input is resetting itself while typing when predictive text is turned on.  It never resets in the google search because predictive text isn&#039;t allowed there (for some reason), but in normal messaging fields it fails on every new word.  I don&#039;t know if this is a problem with the IME engine or a compatibility problem with the ROM.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can someone help me with Apps2SD? Is there any reason for creating two partitions on the SD card (vfat and ext3) if one only needs to access the card from Linux (instead of Windows)? Can the Android-internal applications write to the ext3 partition (so that I can only create one large ext3 partition instead)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m using the latest experimental release. It certainly is faster. However a problem I am having is that when using the copilot satnav things keep forse closing in the background. These have all force closed when running the satnav:
Touch input
Gapps
Zing music player
Calendar
 
The option mesage asks me if I want to wait or force close, if i choose either the box pops up again in a few minutes. 

Other than this, everything is smooth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I went from 4.1.2 to 4.1.9.2 and now I am having IME problems when inputting text in message fields.  SMS, Gmail, Facebook. No problems typing in the search widget or in the browser.  

It is not generating a force close alert.  It simply restarts.  On restart it will let you type 1 word and space then will fail and restart on first letter of second word.  Each restart is around 5 seconds.  

I&#039;ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling, wiping and reflashing,  Nothing seems to fix the problem for me.  

Here is a log.  Sorry its so long, but I don&#039;t know what is useful and what isn&#039;t.  I did highlight where I think the problem is occurring.  http://pastebin.com/d72fc9eb1]]></description>

Thought it might be a &quot;donut&quot;-related error caused by the app... but now you mention that you have this symptom in Local or My tracks....]]></description>
