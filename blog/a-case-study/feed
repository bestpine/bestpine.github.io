		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still waiting for update. any update that fixes this oclick thing but Official and not nightly builds. Is there a way I can get back from choosing a phone with no whatsoever official updates at all? 

I emailed oppo support and here&#039;s what I got as a response. 

&quot;Only Color OS has capability to communicate with O-Click and in future OPPO will provide updates only for Color OS.&quot;

Nice work there. Abandoning the users]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While this has nothing to do with the N1, it would also be great if the CM team/maintainers would communicate with each other. On CM 11 (M, Nightly, and even one or 2 of the Installer builds) for toro/toroplus, there was/is a (admittedly minor) graphical issue characterized by tiny little vertical black lines most notably in the app switcher and when the screen rotates. This issue was apparently fixed in toro several weeks ago, but is still present in toroplus. When asked by many other toroplus users on the CM forums about why it hasn&#039;t been fixed, the most common response was/is something to the effect of &quot;the maintainers don&#039;t usually come here&quot;. Given that this website and these forums are dedicated only entirely to CM, I don&#039;t see why this is the case. A lot of people (myself included) didn&#039;t even know who the toro/toroplus maintainers were (and while the Wiki list was updated Jan 26, the person listed as maintainer for toroplus hasn&#039;t been in that position for &lt;b&gt;several months&lt;/b&gt;).]]></description>
