		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I&#039;m still on dream and will be for at least another 4 or 5 months.  I would completely understand if cy stopped supporting it.  I can&#039;t thank him enough for the work he&#039;s done thus far, making my experience with the dream not only functionally better, but also a hell of a lot more *fun*.  I recognize that its a luxury to have someone, basically for the fun of it, producing something that I benefit greatly from for zero cost, and I will be sad, but completely understanding when it stops.  So, Cy, muchas gracias - its awesome that you&#039;re still supporting us but when you do need to stop...all good.  I&#039;ll see you when I update my handset :)

Plus, my 4.2.13 is so sick I swear its faster than my buddy&#039;s droid (stock rom).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi all,

First, I want thank you for your work and effort... I appreciate what you are doing for the community of obsessed &quot;Dreamers&quot;    

I have my Dream for about one year and I test a lot of roms... only Cyanogen is working perfect in my Dream.

Please do not abandon your work... I really want to try the next equivalent rom before migrating to nexus one. The current budget is not allowing me to buy one.

And now, between guys: 
Do you know how many people were very impressed when they saw my White Dream Phone with the last Cyanogen rom? especially girls... :)  

Sincerely yours,
AndroManiack]]></description>
