		<description><![CDATA[Help!!!! Not sure if this is the best place to as but here goes.........I have a galaxy s2 mobile with cyanogenmod installed-fab. However, from early this month, I was denied playstore, pop ups kept saying retry, along with unfortunately google play had stopped and to contact manufacturer continually displayed. I  removed the playstore app, as the pop up was there every time I touched the phone. I then installed a newer version which my phone wont allow me to open. I contacted Samsung, they told me to factory reset, and that this would restore the playstore back to normal.  This I did, , however I can now no longer use you tube, playstore still doesnt allow me to open. ..when I try to, playstore comes up for a fraction of a section along with the cyanogenmod logo in top left of screen in a shield shape. I now also have no Adobe reader, and cannot re download it, as it says that my phone already had it! When I look at my google account, all my downloads are showing, but cannot open any!!! Is this a cyanogenmod update fault??? Can anyone help? I am not that technical with phones and am going nuts!!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two weeks ago, I used the Windows installer to install CM11 on my Samsung S3. Worked like a dream! Currently contemplating whether I&#039;ll stay with the installer builds or switch to the M builds.
(Since this is my business phone, stability is key. Maybe I&#039;ll buy a second device for tinkering ;-)). ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Making a CyanogenMod store would be highly useful, it would allow people to install their favorite apps without the hassle of installing them through unknown sources, which in turn could increase the operating systems security, also it will make CyanogenMod more appealing to those who wish to distance themselves away from Google and any Google-linked applications, maybe even make new users more comfortable and less frightened if they are new to the Android world :) If CyanogenMod wishes not to roll out their own software repository then they can always use F-Droid, and include it in future CyanogenMod releases :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am from India and using Galaxy S2....had updated it to stock JB from Sammy 4 months ago. It was very laggy and my phone had frequent freezes. Yesterday, I installed Cynogenmod through the installer. Must say its butter smooth. I am a QA Analyst in a reputed SW company. If I would have to rate the two ROMs, I would give twice the score to CM. The main point is that Google is paranoid but CM due to its potential. Once the installer supports more and more device, CMs popularity will skyrocket as it is much easier to  experience CM through it. 
Thanks CM, you guys saved me from having to buy a new phone. Big thumbs up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a hardware fuse welded into the motherboard in the Note 3.  I rooted before someone found a way to get around tripping it, before anyone (who matters to me, anyway) knew it was there. (Yeah, I keep the most recent version update in my Dropbox. Bless his soul forever!)]]></description>
