		<description><![CDATA[Prism nonsense?,  the NSA forming a group with software vendors,  service providers isn&#039;t nonsense.   Or,  you are one of those oh,  its just rumors or we&#039;re conspiracy theorists.   Almost every major world event road on the back of a conspiracy theory  and labeling people conspiracy theorists is a tact to get the general public who don&#039;t know anything besides what football games are on this weekend to look the other way.   I on the other hand care when my ax dollars are being used to fund an organization that constitutionally doesn&#039;t have the right to exist and formally under U. S.  law they officially don&#039;t exist. PRISM and a dozen other programs of it&#039;s sort do exist.   I guess you just drink some pretty crappy coffee. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe ASOP uses DAC or discretionary access control [in lieu of MAC addressed in this blog].. to a point.. they run it through zygote, and if a process is untrusted the zygote takes over.  Interesting CM will be using MAC.  This is a more secure practice though; so, I applaud.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It should not give you these problems in a default install. If so, that is a bug. File it so it can be fixed (sadly, fixing bugs is not Fedoras forte...)



If you get this because you are mucking about and changing things, it&#039;s your own fault and you need to learn how to administer and adapt an SELinux system. Pretty much the same as you&#039;d have to make sure the discretionary access controls (the classic user, group, others permissions) are set up correctly. SELinux is a little less forgiving since the default is to reject access.


That said - SELinux has quite a few advanced concepts and is not that easy to learn. It could be that for you the appropriate thing actually is to disable it (or at least put it in permissive mode). But for something like Cyanogenmod, where the base system should pretty much be what the devs decide, these issues should be minimal.]]></description>
