		<description><![CDATA[So, I&#039;ve read the comments and it seems that a lot of people have had trouble with this rom.

So far (been running 4.1.7 since the hour of release) I haven&#039;t had a single error or non-working app. Camera, Handcent, Widgets, EVERYTHING works as desired. No crashes, no lag, no problems.

On another note, I posted on the XDA thread, and got a response, but I couldn&#039;t work it out myself. The extended menu and hidden apps drawer is gone in this version, a bloke on XDA said to manually install the launcher, all my attempts at that have failed.
Anyone got THAT working?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Kot:
same with me, can&#039;t mount SD. i can read the SD card within G1 (e.g. with linda file explorer), and I can read the SD card with an external card reader, but can&#039;t when it&#039;s inside the G1. Mounting SD card triggers the PC to detect (open the window that searches the contents), but cannot open the folder. When double-click on the driver letter, Windows returns error: &quot;Disk drive not formatted&quot;...

dear CM devs: no criticism, because I admire what you do, and this is an experimental build, so we can expect this to happen, but last night you told me in your last Email in regards to the SD card that it&#039;s a &quot;non-issue&quot;...

seems however many people have this issue not only me...]]></description>
